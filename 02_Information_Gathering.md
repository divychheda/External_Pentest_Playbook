Some covered in OSINT Fundamentals too. Notes in the repo.

## Hunting Breached Credentials
- Look for leaked user:passwd online
- Heath made a tool: https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse to parse a braeached password dataset (you need a db of breached creds before)
- Can also use Dehashed (paid) 
  - Dehashed doesnt always give user:PASSWD, it can give email, phone, hash etc
- 2 attacks possible:
  - Credential Stuffing: take user and passwd from breached list and try to get inside
  - Password spraying: take usernames from the breached list and bruteforce password (not buteforce exactly, can try common passwords)
 
 
 
## Identifying employees and emails
- hunter.io, phonebook.cz etc
- In phonebook.cz, search for a domain like tesla.com (select option email) and it will give list of emails it has 
- Can also scrape linkedin to get employees at an org

## Enumerating Valid Accounts
- If login portal in scope try email:passwd combinations and look for error regarding existence of these creds
- Usually error is like "This email password combination doesnt exist" so we dont know if email is invalid or the password
- In such cases try reset password funcationality and input that email, if you get an error like "email not recognized" then you know email is invalid
- Find all the login portals you can find and test emails on them to find valid users
