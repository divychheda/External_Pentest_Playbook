# Vulnerability Scanning
- Use automated vulnerability scanning tools.
- Mostly Nessus is used.

# Review of Info
- So nessus gives a report of the things it found. You can download it as a .nessus file.
- There are several nessus parsers that parse this file and output a format thats easier to read.
- For eg, http://www.melcara.com/ or one can search on github.
- This gives output as excel sheets with a lot of detail. It can be used with the checklist sheet to keep track of vulnerable hosts.
